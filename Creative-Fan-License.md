#2nd Party- Author License

Many aspects of this project are under ownership of the current rights holder.

To avoid potential legal entanglements with the 1st party, or potential legal entanglements with future licensing, all 3rd party contributors must agree to wave the following rights in respect to the 2nd party, the project author: 

- Right to attribution:
	- The project author(s) (2nd party) will make a "good faith" effort provide credit to the project contributors.  However, the authors may use the material within, in any way they should see fit, without legal obligation to credit 3rd party contributors.  This pertains to all aspects of this project, including any original material, situations, or characters not developed by the project authors.  *If you create material for this project, it is no longer legally yours.*  It is now the property of the project author and the current rights holder.

- Right to financial restitution:
	- The project author(s) (2nd party) may use the material within, in any way they should see fit, without legal obligation to financially reward 3rd party contributors.  This pertains to all aspects of this project, including any original material, situations, or characters not developed by the project author(s).  *If you create material for this project, it is no longer legally yours.*  It is now the property of the project authors and current rights holder.

Additionally, 3rd party contributors agree to the following terms:

- Responsibility of Public Display for 3rd Party Contributors
	- The "Creative Fan License" is in essence, a "good faith" license, designed to insure copyright holders they retain the original rights as well as allow them to profit from derivate works, if they so choose, without legal entanglements.  This license in no way protects you from a cease and desist, a DMCA takedown, or prevents the copyright holder from pursuing any other legal rights they wish to pursue.  The authors are only legally responsible for public displays of project that are displayed with the authors' approval.  Derivative displays are the legal responsibility of the 3rd party contributor displaying his or her work.

This pertains to all aspects of this project, including any original material, situations, or characters not developed by the copyright holder or an official licensor.  *If you create material for this project, it is no longer legally yours.*  It is now the property of the current rights holder.
