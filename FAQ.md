1.  Hey, wait a minute?!  This license doesn't actually give creators any rights at all!  It still gives all rights, including financial gain, to the copyright holder!

Correct.  This license is what I refer to as a "Good Faith" license. No license, no matter how well written, can grant any rights to someone not given to them by the copyright holder. The license basically is a way to say, "Hey, we're not trying to steal your copyright." It explicitly states repeatedly that the original copyright holder retains all rights. This license does not prevent a C&D or a DMCA takedown. It only attempts to persuade the rights holder such tactics are not necessary.
